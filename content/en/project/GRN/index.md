Gene regulatory networks represent the complex control systems that orchestrate gene expression in organisms. These networks are formed by interactions between genes, transcription factors, and other regulatory molecules, which collectively determine when and where specific genes are activated or repressed. These interactions allow organisms to respond in a precise and coordinated manner to internal and external stimuli, adapting to changes in their environment or developmental signals.

Studying and modeling these networks is essential to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions, such as development, stress response, and evolutionary adaptation. Gene regulatory networks are also key to understanding complex diseases, such as cancer, where alterations in these systems can lead to gene dysregulation and anomalous cellular behavior. By analyzing these networks, critical genes and pathways can be identified, offering potential therapeutic targets.

In the BioMinNet lab, we build gene regulatory networks using different methodological strategies. These include curating regulatory interactions from the scientific literature, constructing networks using homology from reference networks, expanding networks using weight matrices and binding sites, and reconstructing them using machine learning algorithms from gene expression data. This comprehensive approach allows us to capture both the static architecture and the functional dynamics of networks, providing a more complete view of gene regulation in different organisms.
