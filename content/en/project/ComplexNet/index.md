The present project aims to develop and implement computational tools based on graph theory, which allow us to identify and analyze networks that underlie written texts from the perspective of a narrator who is a witness or participant in the narrated processes, in order to understand the dynamics of a society at a given time.
As a first part of the project, we seek to build and make available to the scientific community and the general public a digital repository with a wide collection of historical corpora, mainly personal diaries and correspondence.
In a second stage, we seek to build and implement a set of computational tools that make possible the classification and identification of constitutive elements, relationships between them, and the construction of networks, all this from the books and documents that make up the corpus. Finally, the networks obtained will be analyzed using these tools and in a third stage, mathematical models will be proposed that allow us to understand the structure and construction of societies at different times in history.
